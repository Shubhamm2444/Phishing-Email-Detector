** Phishing emails can also appear to be from legitimate sources and use proper capitalization. Here's an improved approach:
Reduce Emphasis on Capitalization:
While some phishing attempts might have poor capitalization, it's not a reliable indicator. We'll remove this check from the updateResult function.

** Highlight "Low Risk" for Clean Emails:
We can keep the existing logic for displaying "Low Risk" when the risk score is 0. This suggests a potentially legitimate email.

1: Focus on Red Flags, Not Capitalization:
Remove Capitalization Check: Eliminate the check for starting with a capital letter in the updateResult function. It's unreliable for identifying phishing attempts.
Refine Red Flags: Consider expanding the redFlags object to include more sophisticated checks:
Sender Reputation: Utilize third-party APIs (if applicable) to check the sender's email address reputation. A known spam sender would raise a red flag.
Generic Links: Detect generic links like "click here" or shortened URLs that hide the true destination.
Threats and Urgency: Look for language that creates a sense of urgency or threatens negative consequences if you don't respond immediately.
Suspicious Attachments: Identify emails with attachments you weren't expecting, especially those with executable extensions (e.g., .exe, .bat).

2:Probabilistic Risk Score:
Weight Red Flags: Assign different weights to red flags based on their severity. For example, a request for personal information might be weighted higher than a generic greeting.
Cumulative Score: Calculate a cumulative risk score by summing the weights of all detected red flags.

3:Risk Message Interpretation:
Refine Risk Levels: Maintain the "Low," "Medium," and "High" risk categories.
Low Risk (0 Score): No red flags detected, but caution is still advised.
Medium Risk (1-2 Score): A few red flags present, proceed with caution and verify sender legitimacy.
High Risk (3+ Score): Multiple red flags detected, exercise high caution and consider not interacting with the email.

4:Educational Resources:
Phishing Tips: Provide users with additional resources on how to identify phishing attempts beyond the risk score, such as checking sender addresses, verifying links before clicking, and not sharing personal information through email.

Remember:
This is a simplified model. Real-world phishing attempts are constantly evolving.
Machine learning techniques can be explored for more advanced detection in the future.
